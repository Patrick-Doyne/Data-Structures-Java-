##  Directory Description

`Rep Invariants` is a focused Java folder showcasing two distinct perspectives on software architecture—one centered on design iteration, the other on specification enforcement. Each suite stands alone, yet both contribute to a shared theme: code clarity through structure and discipline.

- **Queue Selection Suite**  
  A modular experiment in refining selection logic across evolving queue-handling classes. From brittle base implementations to strategy-powered, generic structures, it chronicles the transition toward flexible, decoupled design. Think of it as an architectural time-lapse: each file captures a stage of growth.

- **Stack Suite**  
  A targeted look at correctness via abstraction enforcement and fault isolation. One stack behaves. One stack deliberately breaks. Together, they reveal how rep invariants govern internal sanity—and how structured tests can expose silent violations. It's part spec, part stress test.

Intended as both academic artifact and recruiter prompt, the folder speaks to thoughtful engineering: not just writing code, but designing systems that explain themselves.
