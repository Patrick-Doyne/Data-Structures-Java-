*Directory Description*:

    - This folder contains excercises & small user defined software API's that show the importance of following SOLID principles when coding in Java:
    
              1) Single Responsibility Principle:
                    - The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
                    This helps in reducing the complexity and increasing the maintainability of the code over time.
                    
              2) Open/Closed Principal:
                    - The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can extend a class's
                    behavior without modifying its source code.
                    
              3) Liskov's Substitution Principal:

                    - The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the 
                    correctness of the program.
                    
              4) Interface Segregation Principal:

                    - The Interface Segregation Principle states that larger interfaces should be divided into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing
                    classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them.
                    
              5) Dependency Inversion Example:

                    - The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but both should depend on abstractions. 
                    This helps in decoupling the code and making it more flexible.
