*Directory Description*:

      - This directory contains several subdirectories each focusing in different areas of OOP in Java. Programs inside interact with GUI's, SQL, and (Coming Soon) Python to represent
      data visually.

            1) Data Structures:
                  - Holds basic data structures; modeled in Java specifically. In general, the projects within cover HashMaps, DLL, SLL, and search trees 
                  - Good display of generics and OOP prinicples
                  - Programs use either a CLI in the terminal, GUI, or hardcoded values
                  
            2) Software Specification and Construction (SOLID):
                  - Contains excersises and small userdefined software API's that strongly follow SOLID principals. Improves and draws on
                  many of the concepts from Liskov's work.
                  
            3) Aurora & Everest Project:
                  - This directory is currently a work in process.... 
                  - README.md files will be added to subdirectories once project is finished...
                  - Whats the Goal?:
                        * Take an excel and MSSQL data project I did for a company during a student-intership project, a few small user defined API's
                        that follow SOLID principles, and the JDBC import driver (used to connect the software to MSSQL) provided by Spring Boot dependencies. 
                        Allows us to abstracts away all the nitty gritty. This can be seen as the "Industrial" grade backend since we have a concurrent enviornment
                        used for storing instances/records in a MSSQL DB. 
                        
                        Then create a React form that sends requests to Node.js to populate graphical representations of the different data points (depends on the 
                        button a user presses).

                        Currently have a very strong grasp of Java, MSSQL, SOLID prinicples, and Spring Boot basics for a CRUD app
                        
###### (NOTE FOR OPTION #3: I'm learning this on my own. Since I am a full-time student and work 20-30 hours a week at a resturaunt my goal is to finish by EOY :) )
