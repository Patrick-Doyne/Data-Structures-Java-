*Directory Description*:

      - This directory contains several subdirectories each focusing in different areas of OOP in Java. Programs inside interact with GUI's, SQL, and (Coming Soon) Python to represent
      data visually.

            1) Data Structures:
                  - Subdirectory contains 2 projects inside. The first resembles a stock monitor and implements basic data structures. The
                  second produces a visual walkthrough of a topological sort and the logic each step of the way. Shown through GUI.
                  
            2) Software Specification and Construction (SOLID):
                  - Contains excersises and small userdefined software API's that strongly follow SOLID principals. Improves and draws on
                  many of the concepts from Liskov's work.
                  
            3) Aurora & Everest Project:
                  - This directory is currently a work in process....
                  - Whats the Goal?:
                        * Take an excel and MSSQL data project I did for a company during a student-intership project, a few small user defined API's
                        that follow SOLID principles, the JDBC import driver (used to connect the software to MSSQL) , and funnel all of that data to 
                        a Python file that can run analyitcs and show graphical results. 
  #### (NOTE: I might use RESTFUL API's for A&E Project to move data into python, but not sure yet :) ) ####
